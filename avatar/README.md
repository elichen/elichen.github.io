# Avatar Lip Sync - Real-time Mouth Animation + Idle Animation

A high-quality, real-time lip sync system that animates a 3D avatar's mouth from microphone input with natural idle body movement, using Three.js WebGL and advanced audio processing.

## Features

### High-Quality Audio Processing
- **16kHz Audio Capture**: Optimized for speech recognition accuracy
- **Advanced Frequency Analysis**: Multi-band spectral analysis with FFT
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Intelligent silence detection to prevent false triggers
- **Hysteresis & Smoothing**: Prevents jitter and maintains natural mouth movements

### Professional 3D Rendering & Animation
- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated rendering at 60fps (WebGPU fallback implemented)
- **VRM Avatar Support**: Industry-standard 3D character format with facial expressions
- **Layered Animation System**: Idle body movement + real-time lip sync simultaneously  
- **Natural Idle Animation**: VRoid Hub-style breathing, body sway, and head movement
- **Smooth Expression Blending**: EMA-based interpolation for natural transitions
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for <100ms end-to-end latency

### Intelligent Viseme Detection
- **5-Viseme System**: A, E, I, O, U + Rest state
- **Spectral Classification**: Frequency band analysis for accurate mouth shape detection
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Multi-frame averaging to reduce noise
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on voice characteristics

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            
            <h3>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)</h3>
            <p>
                This AI uses PPO, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that learns through trial and error. 
                PPO is more stable than traditional policy gradient methods because it limits how much the AI's policy 
                can change in each training step, preventing catastrophic forgetting.
            </p>

            <h3>Self-Play Training</h3>
            <p>
                The AI learns by playing against itself. Both the top and bottom paddles are controlled by the same 
                neural network, but they learn from different perspectives. This self-play approach allows the AI to 
                discover and adapt to increasingly sophisticated strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>Training Curriculum</h3>
            <p>
                The AI learns in three stages:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hit Puck:</strong> First learns basic puck interaction (500 successful hits to advance)</li>
                <li><strong>Score Goal:</strong> Learns to aim shots toward the goal (50 goals to advance)</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Develops advanced offensive and defensive tactics</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Reward System</h3>
            <p>
                The AI receives rewards for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting closer to the puck</li>
                <li>Successfully hitting the puck</li>
                <li>Hitting the puck toward the opponent's goal</li>
                <li>Scoring goals (+10 points)</li>
                <li>Maintaining good defensive position</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It receives penalties for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Letting in goals (-10 points)</li>
                <li>Moving away from the puck</li>
                <li>Time passing without action (-0.001 per step)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Toggle Button</h3>
            <p>
                The toggle button switches between:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training Mode:</strong> Both paddles are AI-controlled, learning through self-play</li>
                <li><strong>Play Mode:</strong> Top paddle is AI-controlled, bottom paddle follows your mouse</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Learning Time</h3>
            <p>
                The AI typically needs about 20,000 training steps to develop basic gameplay skills. During this time, 
                it progresses from random movements to purposeful hits, and eventually to strategic gameplay.

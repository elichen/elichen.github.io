            <h2>What are Red-Black Trees?</h2>
            <p>Red-Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees with an extra bit of information per node: the color (red or black).</p>

            <h2>Properties of Red-Black Trees</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every node is either red or black.</li>
                <li>The root is always black.</li>
                <li>Every leaf (NIL) is black.</li>
                <li>If a node is red, then both its children are black.</li>
                <li>For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.</li>

                <p>
                    Rebalancing in a Red-Black Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced after insertion or deletion of nodes, maintaining efficient operation times. The rebalancing process involves a series of color changes and rotations based on specific cases.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> <em>The new node is the root.</em>  
                        <br>Color the new node black.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> <em>The parent of the new node is black.</em>  
                        <br>No action needed as the tree remains balanced.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Case 3:</strong> <em>Both the parent and the uncle of the new node are red.</em>  
                        <br>Recolor the parent and uncle to black, and the grandparent to red. Then, continue fixing from the grandparent.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Case 4:</strong> <em>The parent is red, the uncle is black, and the new node is a right child.</em>  
                        <br>Perform a left rotation on the parent.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Case 5:</strong> <em>The parent is red, the uncle is black, and the new node is a left child.</em>  
                        <br>Perform a right rotation on the grandparent and swap the colors of the parent and grandparent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These steps ensure that the Red-Black Tree properties are maintained, guaranteeing that the tree remains balanced with a height of O(log n), which allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

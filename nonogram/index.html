        <h2>About Nonograms</h2>
        <div class="info-content">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Nonograms, also known as Picross or Griddlers, were invented in 1987 by Japanese graphics editor Non Ishida. They became popular in Japan in 1988 after being published in Nintendo's "Monthly Manga Club" magazine. The puzzles were introduced to the West in 1990 by games publisher Puzzler Media.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The numbers on the top and left side of the grid represent groups of filled squares in each row or column.</li>
                <li>For example, "4 2" means there's a group of 4 filled squares, then at least one empty square, followed by a group of 2 filled squares.</li>
                <li>Your goal is to fill in the correct squares to reveal the hidden picture.</li>
                <li>Left-click to fill a square, right-click to mark a square with an X (indicating you believe it should remain empty).</li>
                <li>Use logic to determine which squares should be filled based on the given numbers.</li>
                <li>The puzzle is solved when all correct squares are filled, revealing the emoji picture!</li>
            </ol>

# Becoming Technical

## Thesis

The workplace is evolving faster than most people realize. At AI Fund, we've watched AI automate increasing amounts of daily office work, and with it, we've discovered a fundamental shift in what makes people valuable. The profile of successful roles across every position—from product management to sales to operations—is changing. And the change is simple: everyone needs to become more technical.

Here's the surprising part: "technical" doesn't mean what it used to mean. It goes beyond learning to code in Python or understanding database schemas. Technical now means developing fluency with frontier technologies, particularly frontier AI. And the barrier to entry has never been lower.

## What We've Discovered

Across our portfolio companies, we're seeing the same pattern emerge. The people who thrive in this new environment share one common trait: they understand and actively use frontier AI technologies. They know what LLMs can do. They understand multi-modal AI capabilities. They grasp the practical implications of transformer architecture limitations like context windows and hallucinations. Most importantly, they know mitigation techniques—how to ground AI outputs, how to control error rates in AI agents through frameworks and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

The people staying technical and relevant are overwhelmingly software engineers. Engineers have something critical: a constructivist learning philosophy. They read white papers, they attend conferences, and most importantly—they learn by building.

## The Constructivist Advantage

Engineers instinctively understand that the best way to learn a technology is to use it. Build something, break it, fix it, improve it. This approach matters more than ever because the AI landscape is awash in noise.

On one side, you have the singularity crowd convinced that AI will achieve recursive self-improvement and transcend human intelligence within months. On the other, you have skeptics dismissing LLMs as stochastic parrots—pattern matchers incapable of true reasoning.

The reality? You can't know where the truth lies without getting your hands dirty. You need to experience AI's capabilities and limitations firsthand. Reading hot takes on Twitter won't give you the intuition you need. Building will.

## Alien Intelligence

Here's what most people miss: AI is genuinely alien—it thinks differently than we do. Treating it as such unlocks its potential.

The best mental model is to think of AI as an alien intelligence with jagged capabilities—superhuman in some dimensions, surprisingly weak in others. Like learning a musical instrument, developing intuition for these capabilities takes hours of practice. You need to understand what goes into context windows, how tokens get generated, where the model excels, and where it consistently fails.

Using AI well is currently more art than science. Like any art, mastery comes from practice alongside theory.

## The Practical Path

**Start Using AI-Assisted Coding Tools**: Install Cursor or Claude Code. Pick a project—any project. Maybe it's automating a spreadsheet task. Maybe it's building a simple web app. The specific project doesn't matter as much as the act of building.

**Build Something with LLMs**: Create a tool that uses language models. A chatbot for your website. A document summarizer. An email classifier. Get familiar with prompts, responses, temperature settings, and token limits.

**Understand the Fundamentals**: Learn what actually happens when you send text to an LLM. What's a context window? How does tokenenization work? What's the difference between stateful and stateless APIs? You need to grasp the concepts, even if you skip the underlying math.

**Ask AI to Explain Itself**: Here's a secret—AI is surprisingly good at explaining what it just did. When it writes code for you, ask it to explain each part. When it makes a decision, ask about alternatives. Treat it like a teaching assistant who never gets tired of questions.

This might feel uncomfortable at first. You'll feel slow and clumsy, like a child learning to write. That's the point. Discomfort is the feeling of learning happening.

## The Democratization of Technical Skills

The barrier to becoming technical has collapsed. You no longer need to spend years learning programming languages, memorizing syntax, or understanding compiler errors. AI can handle that for you. What you need is curiosity and persistence.

Think about what this means: A product manager can now prototype features without waiting for engineering resources. A salesperson automate much of their sales/conversion funnel. An operations manager can create internal tools to multiply productivity.

Many people feel genuinely intimidated by technology, and that's completely understandable. But the landscape has changed dramatically—the ramp to proficiency is gentler than it's ever been, with AI as your non-judging tutor.

## Why This Matters for Your Career

We're entering an era where technical fluency is table stakes. Understanding technology—particularly AI—is becoming fundamental to every role, even if you are not a software engineer.

The marketing manager who can't use AI to analyze customer segments will be outpaced by one who can. The financial analyst who relies solely on Excel while competitors leverage AI for pattern recognition will fall behind. The HR leader who doesn't understand how AI screening tools work will lose ground to AI-native HR organizations.

This means augmenting human capabilities with alien intelligence while preserving human judgment. The people who thrive will be those who learn to balance well — who know when to lean on AI's strengths and when to apply human insight.

## The Perfect Time to Start

If you're entering the workforce now, you have an incredible advantage: you're starting fresh in an AI-native world. You don't have decades of pre-AI habits to unlearn. You can build the right intuitions from day one.

The good news: you can start today. Open Claude or ChatGPT. Ask it to help you build something simple. A to-do list app. A recipe organizer. A budget tracker. The specific project matters less than starting.

Pay attention to where it excels and where it struggles. Notice when its suggestions are brilliant and when they're nonsensical. Build that intuition through direct experience. Every small project teaches you something valuable about working with AI.

Young professionals who develop these skills early will shape the future of work. You're pioneering new ways of working that previous generations are still figuring out. The companies you'll join need people who intuitively understand how to leverage alien intelligence.

Becoming technical is your competitive edge. It's just about time and attention. And starting now means you have both in abundance. While others debate whether AI matters, you can be mastering it.
